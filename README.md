Welcome to my personal github where, when I get the spare time, I love to build / design things for the web or mobile and experiment with new technologies.

These days, I mostly use:  
[Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) /  [React](https://reactjs.org/) / [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) / [Next JS](https://nextjs.org/) and [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/). For image hosting: [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/). For DB mangagement: [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) or [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and for hosting,  either: [Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) / [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

Check out what Iâ€™m up [now](https://www.danielvanc.com/now), what I tech [use](https://www.danielvanc.com/uses/) and what Iâ€™ve [written lately](https://www.danielvanc.com/notes/).
