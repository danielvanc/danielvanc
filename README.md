![Daniel Van Cuylenburg - Front-end Developer](https://res.cloudinary.com/danielvanc/image/upload/v1594321018/logo3.jpg)

Welcome to my personal github where, when I get the spare time, I love to build / design things for the web or mobile and experiment with new technologies.

These days I mostly code with: [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) /  [React](https://reactjs.org/) / [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) / [Next JS](https://nextjs.org/) [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/). Host images on: [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/). Mangage data with: [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) or [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and host my sites / apps with either: [Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) / [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

**Studying:**
I'm learning a ton of stuff on [FrontendMasters](https://frontendmasters.com/). This year, for the fun of it, I completed the [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/danielvanc/responsive-web-design), [JavaScript Alogorihthms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/danielvanc/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures), and [Front-end Libraries](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/danielvanc/front-end-libraries) freeCodeCamp.org certificates.

I'm looking to learn next: [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), [Fauna](https://fauna.com/), [Express JS](https://expressjs.com/), [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/)

Check out what I’m up [now](https://www.danielvanc.com/now), what I tech [use](https://www.danielvanc.com/uses/) and what I’ve [written lately](https://www.danielvanc.com/notes/).
