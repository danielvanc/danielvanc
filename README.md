Welcome to my personal github where, when I get the spare time, I love to build / design things for the web or mobile and experiment with new technologies.

These days, I mostly code in:  Styled Components /  Theme UI /  Bulma / Tailwind / React / Gatsby / Next JS / Apollo GraphQL / Firebase / AWS / Fauna Gatsby Cloud / Vercel and Netlify.

Check out what Iâ€™m up [now](https://www.danielvanc.com/now), what I [use](https://www.danielvanc.com/uses/) and what Iâ€™ve [written lately](https://www.danielvanc.com/notes/).
