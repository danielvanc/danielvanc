Hi! I'm Dan, from the Isle of Wight in the U.K. When I get the spare time, I like to build / design, demo's / personal projects that allow me to experiment with current and new technologies that are available for the web.

My tools of the trade are: [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/),  [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [Next JS](https://nextjs.org/), [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/). Write tests with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), [React testing library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library) and [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). Host media on [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/). Manage data with: [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) or [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and have my sites / apps build with either: [Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

*Find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielvanc/) and [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/danielvanc).
